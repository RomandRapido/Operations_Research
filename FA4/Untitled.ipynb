    "Midtown Bank always has two tellers on duty. Customers arrive to receive service from a teller at a mean rate of 40 per hour. A teller requires an average of 2 minutes to serve a customer. When both tellers are busy, an arriving customer joins a single line to wait for service. Experience has shown that customers wait in line an average of 1 minute before service begins.\n",
    "## (a) Describe why this is a queueing system.\n",
    "This scenario is a queueing system because:\n",
    "* When customers arrive, they are asked to get behind the line before they could receive the business' service. \n",
    "* An arrival rate was given with 40 customers per hour.\n",
    "* There are servers waiting in front of the line (two of them) who will provide the service once a person gets in front.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, since the business can't serve all customers at the same time and have to wait in line to be served, this system is queueing.\n",
